#    Sort the list and find the min and max age
#    Add the min age and the max age again to the list
#    Find the median age (one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
#    Find the average age (sum of all items divided by their number )
#    Find the range of the ages (max minus min)
# Compare the value of (min - average) and (max - average), use abs() method
# 1. Find the middle country(ies) in the countries list
# 2. Divide the countries list into two equal lists if it is even if not one more country for the first half.
